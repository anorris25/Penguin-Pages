          <h2 class="club-title">Jazz in the Hill: Nightlife and Narratives of A Pittsburgh Neighborhood by Harper</h2>
          <p class="author">by Colter Harper</p>
          <p class="book-descript">This read is a richly detailed exploration of Pittsburgh's Hill District, once a vibrant center of Black 
            cultural life and a thriving jazz scene from the 1920s through the 1960s. Harper delves into how jazz clubs in this neighborhood 
            were more than entertainment venues—they were pivotal in fostering a self-determined African American community. The book examines 
            the intricate networks of patrons, musicians, and business owners who contributed to community building, set against the backdrop
             of significant historical contexts such as Prohibition, urban redevelopment, and the civil rights movement. Through this lens, 
             Harper illustrates how the Hill District's musical legacy continues to influence its identity and development today.</p>

          <p class="author">by LLoyd Brown</p>
          <p class="book-descript">This powerful novel by Lloyd L. Brown is set in Pittsburgh's Allegheny County Jail, drawing from the author's
             own experiences as a labor organizer and political prisoner. The story centers on Lonnie James, a young Black man falsely accused of
              murder, and the collective efforts of three fellow Black Communist inmates who rally to prove his innocence. Through this narrative,
               the novel delves into themes of systemic racism, class struggle, and the pursuit of justice, offering a vivid portrayal of
                mid-20th-century America's social and political landscape.​
