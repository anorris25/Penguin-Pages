    <h2 class="page-heading">About</h2>

    <p class="blurb">Penguin Pages is an online platform designed to bring people in their 20s together through a shared
         love of classic and contemporary literature. By creating a space for engaging discussions, unique 
         recommendations and community interaction, this project aims to foster intellectual growth, 
         cultural appreciation, and meaningful connections among its members. <br> <br> The club will emphasize a 
         selection of classic literary works and complementary modern texts to offer a comprehensive 
         collection of works that are relevant and interesting to people in their 20's who have a goal to 
         read more frequently in substitution of social media platforms. Although online book clubs 
         currently exist, this platform was created with the intention of targeting readers in Pittsburgh
            specifically, to potentially connect readers who are in the same city that would not otherwise
         interact.</p>
