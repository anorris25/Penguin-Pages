          <p class="author">by Philip K. Dick</p>
          <p class="book-descript">This 1969 science fiction novel is set in a future where psychic abilities are common and technology allows
             the deceased to remain in a state of "half-life," enabling limited consciousness and communication. The story follows Joe Chip,
              a technician at Runciter Associates, a company employing individuals with abilities to counteract psychics, providing clients
               with privacy and security. After a mission on the Moon goes awry, resulting in the apparent death of the company's head, Glen
                Runciter, Joe and his colleagues begin to experience strange shifts in reality, with time seemingly regressing and objects
                 reverting to outdated forms. Amidst this disorienting environment, a mysterious product called Ubik appears to offer temporary
                  relief from the deteriorating reality. The novel delves into themes of reality versus illusion, life and death, and the
                   influence of commercialism, all wrapped in a narrative that challenges the reader's perception of what is real.​</p>

          <p class="author">by Karen Thompson Walker</p>
          <p class="book-descript">This contemplative novel is set in the fictional town of Santa Lora, California, where a mysterious illness
             causes people to fall into a deep, unending sleep. The narrative follows a diverse group of characters—including college students,
              a young couple with a newborn, and two sisters—as they navigate the unfolding crisis. As the epidemic spreads and the town is
               quarantined, those afflicted exhibit unprecedented brain activity, suggesting they are experiencing vivid dreams. The novel delves
                into themes of consciousness, the boundary between reality and dreams, and the human response to uncertainty, all conveyed through
                 lyrical prose and shifting perspectives.​
